Entry Hall
40 40
You are in a dark, nasty little room with 2 doors, one to the west and one to
the north. There is a stone table with some mostly eaten food and huge plates with equally 
huge utensils. Good luck if you run into whatever was eating with that stuff. You are in 
luck, though, as there are two full bottles of healing potion under the table. Those might
come in handy later.

You enter a greasy shop.  Some of these tools have cobwebs on them, indicating
that they haven't been used in ages. You think otherwise about using them. Exits are

A weapons room!  You see a variety of weapons, although most of them have rusted over, some of the choices look promising, you might need to search a little to find something that could be useful. The only exit is the way you came in.

Training Area

Making your way into the Training Area, you feel like you can take on the world!  You take
a good look around and see that there are a number of trophies for 1st place in prize fighting.  You could spend all day looking at all competitions, won, but you have other things to do.  Your exits include the south, and only the south.

Library

You feel the like your are back in the Academy.  You are surrounded by a multitude of 
shelves filled with books.  They even have one of those ladders to get to the top shelf.  If only you had the time to read each one, what a difference maker you would be!  You can either return south, or try the door on the west.

Small Hallway

This small hallway you have entered is just that, a small hallway.  You look around
but nothing is interesting.  Perhaps life would be better if you headed north to what looks like a reception area, or east, which is how you entered the Small Hallway.

A disheveled barracks stands before you.  You suspect a surprise attack happened here, some of the deceased are still in their bunks.  From what you can tell, this was somebody's horrific nightmare.  There is a door returning west.

Mess Hall

No wonder they call it a Mess Hall!  There is rotten food everywhere, the stench is enough to make you gag.  Do what you need to do in here, and get the heck out!  You scan for exits, and see that you can head north for a hallway, or west, which leads to the way you came in.

Wonderful. Yet another hallway.  At least you aren't crammed into this one, and for once, it doesn't smell hideous.  You can actually breathe the air here, and notice two doors, one to the east, and one to the west.

You have entered a typical Study room.  You see a compilation of maps, books, and reference material.  You see a desk, but the drawers have been removed, somebody was looking for something important. Your can go west, which will take you back into the Large Hallway.

Bedroom

Ahhhh. You see a nice comfy bed, but you decide against sleeping on it.  Based on other findings in this creepy get-up.  Still though it looks tempting and you sit on the bed.  While relaxing, you feel a slight breeze, and notice a secret passage. An escape exit! This is your way out! If you had to, could take the secret passage to the north, or return east, back to the Large Hallway.
